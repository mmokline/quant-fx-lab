> **Research-driven FX option pricing, volatility calibration, and hedging simulation framework**  
_Currently under active development_

---

## 🚀 Overview
Developing a research-driven framework for FX option pricing, volatility calibration, and hedging simulation.  
The project integrates classical models (**Black-Scholes**, **Binomial Trees**) with advanced methods (**GARCH**, **Heston**) and an **interactive Streamlit dashboard** for risk analysis.
